# Product backlog

Updated 2026-10-08. This file tracks **outstanding work only**. Implemented behaviour and release history belong elsewhere:
- [README.md](README.md);
- the [application changelog](web/src/changelog/entries.ts);
- the topic guides under `.claude/docs/`.

Entries are proposals, not delivery commitments.

**Status tags.** Every top-level item under a `##` section opens with one tag:
- `[next]`: what comes next;
- `[todo]`: confirmed, to do;
- `[new]`: proposed, not yet confirmed. That includes the decisions only the user can take. Claude adds items as
  `[new]`, and only the user promotes them;
- `[parked]`: deliberately set aside until a trigger;
- `[blocked]`: waiting on someone or something else.

The `backlog` mod (`liveweird/claude-mods`) summarises the tags on the status line and in `/backlog`.

## After the first real sync (needs the user)

The first real-Jira sync works end to end (2026-10-08, #112–#116): SYNC, PROCESS, DERIVE and RECONCILE on COOK.

## Phase 3 follow-ups (the domain model, v0.3.0)

Plan: `~/.claude/plans/flow-phase3-metrics.md`. The §0 amendments A1–A27 override the body.

- [parked] **`epic_domain_key` as-of.** Today it uses the epic's current domain, because no epic-domain history
  exists. Real data is in now; evaluate whether a parent move across projects shows up in COOK's changelog.
  - Evaluated 2026-10-09: COOK's changelog (2025-07-23 → 2026-09-25) has NO `project` or `Key` change on any issue.
    Its 100 `IssueParentAssociation` changes are re-parentings inside the project (30 tasks, 4 epics under the
    Program), which never change an epic's domain. Nothing to fix on real data; a candidate for [parked].
  - Parked by the user 2026-10-23: nothing to fix on real data.
- [parked] **Read `hoursPerDay` from Jira's time-tracking configuration (A5).** Real data is in now; check the
  endpoint and its scope on the tenant.
  - Parked by the user 2026-10-23: Flow's own `hoursPerDay` setting is enough unless the tenant uses a non-8-hour day.
- [parked] **Cache validators for the report endpoints.** Draft PR #75 (ETag/304; its atomic DERIVE success mark shipped
  separately, so the draft now conflicts in `metrics/`) is open, waiting on the cache-posture sign-off. Compare people's capacity rows depend on the caller (ADMIN or the
  managers of every team involved; the Cost matrix's capacity column that shared this caveat was removed), so a report ETag must
  include that verdict for `/reports/compare-people` (or exempt it), or a 304 would serve the rows to someone else.
  - Parked by the user 2026-10-23 while report latency is fine; draft #75 stays open untouched.
- [blocked] **Sprint capacities from Jira Plans.** Probed 2026-10-08: the Plans REST API (`/rest/api/3/plans/plan`, then
  `…/team/atlassian/{id}` for `capacity`, `planningStyle`, `sprintLength` and `issueSourceId`) returns 403 to the sync
  service account: "You do not have the Administer Jira global permission". Every Plans endpoint needs it, reads included.
  - No-go while that holds: a read-only sync token is not escalated to Jira admin for one figure per team.
  - Still unknown: whether the site has Premium, whether COOK's plan team has a capacity set, and in which unit.
  - Even with access: the capacity is in the plan's estimation unit (story points can't be converted to MD; hours need
    A5), it is one figure per team rather than per sprint, and the API is experimental.
  - If Atlassian drops the admin requirement: an optional REFERENCE step (like `PROJECT_FIELDS`), plan team →
    `issueSourceId` board → `board_team_map`, and a `PLAN` capacity source ranked CONFIGURED > PLAN > DEFAULT.
  - Blocked (2026-10-23) on the Administer Jira requirement.
- [parked] **A28 — a composite estimate for estimated backlog.** Parked 2026-10-01: the teams do not estimate via
  sub-tasks.
  - Estimated backlog uses the OWN estimate only, so a parent estimated through its sub-tasks
    (`estimate_source = SUBTASKS`) is missing from it.
  - The fix is a composite-estimate bridge. Velocity (`sprintScope`) needs the same composite, or backlog-in-sprints
    is overstated.
  - Number the amendment A28 (A23 is taken).

## Engineering follow-ups

- [new] **Report the two r2dbc-postgresql 1.1.3 bugs upstream (needs the user: a public action).** Found 2026-10-23 (build-times WHY 24):
  `ReactorNettyClient.BackendMessageSubscriber.demandMore()` checks "no buffered items" and CASes the demand in two steps, so a
  preempted consumer re-requests 256 rows onto a nearly full buffer ("Response queue is full", reproduced with a 300 µs park); and on that
  error `onError` completes the request sink, `handleClose()` sets `isClosed` first, so `close()` is a no-op and the socket/backend leak
  (Flow's `LeakedSocketGuard` closes it; its `LeakedSocketGuardTest` turns red when upstream fixes the leak, and the guard can go).
  Draft issue text: the description of PR #311. The only Flow-side cure for the overflow itself
  (a fetch size < ~250 rows) costs a round trip per statement and is not taken.
- [todo] **CI duration: check the trend at every milestone.** Run `node scripts/timings/ci-times.mjs --branch master`.
  A trend jump gets an investigation, never a raised budget.
  - Last checked 2026-10-24 (1.16.1): `server` median-5 11m19s (prev-5 13m38s), `web` 3m36s (prev-5 3m32s), `images` 3m33s — both still
    over their alarms on the runner draw, no new jump. 2026-10-23 (1.14.3): `server` median-5 14m12s (OVER the 10-min alarm), `web` 3m27s (TREND +33 %, over its 3-min alarm) —
    mostly the runner draw (identical code 1.7x apart; 16 of 23 master runs on 10-23 drew a slow runner), real growth ~5 % (server) /
    ~12 % (web tests); weights refreshed, CI runs `check :server:installDist`; the alarm on a slow runner needs a paid 8-vCPU runner (the
    user's call) — `build-times.md` status check 2026-10-23. 2026-10-21 (1.6.1): `server` median-5 10m02s (on its 10-min alarm), `web` 3m12s (TREND +43 %, over its 3-min alarm) —
    both the runner draw (bimodal fast/slow runners; `build-times.md` status check 2026-10-21); WHY 20-23's "CI after" filled in;
    `web` ~10-20 s over its alarm on slow runners is accepted. 2026-10-18 (1.0.0): `server` median-5 12m09s (+52 %, over the 10-min alarm), `web` 3m28s (over its 3-min
    alarm), `images` 3m08s — runner-speed draw plus ~10 % server / ~20 % web suite growth (`build-times.md` WHY 19). 2026-10-17:
    `server` 13m41s (WHY 18: runner speed, suite growth, fork imbalance — the imbalance is fixed). 2026-10-15: `server` 6m36s; no jump. The nightly `e2e`
    had been red since 10-07 on a runner change (buildx bake fs entitlements), fixed the same day.
  - Where it stands:
    - `server` takes 8 min on a fast runner and 13–14 on a slow one (from ~30 on 2026-09-30);
    - `web` takes ~3 min;
    - the CI timeout is 25 min.
  - Budgets, history and the open WHY questions are in `.claude/docs/build-times.md`. Local runs use
    `scripts/gates.sh`.
- [parked] **Data profile: multi-project boards.** A board whose filter spans several projects shows no observed or
  unmapped statuses, because `BoardRef` carries a single project key. Revisit if real boards span projects.
- [parked] **D6 — de-Jira the `Connector` seam: not before the GitLab connector (YAGNI).**
  - Today these are Jira-shaped:
    - `ingest/Connector.kt` `testConnection(siteUrl, email, apiToken, projectKeys, authScheme)`;
    - `JiraConnectorKey` in `DataSourceRoutes.kt`;
    - `DataSourceRequest.jira`.
  - Generalising them is speculative until a second connector exists. Revisit with GitLab.
- [new] **A production-scale check: ~10 projects the size of ONBOARDING (~64k issues).** The user (2026-10-24): production
  will hold about ten projects of ONBOARDING's size (6,391 issues, ~235k changelog entries, ~34k worklogs each). Measured so far:
  one ONBOARDING backfill takes 46-53 min; the report measurements stop at scale B (12k done tasks), ~5x below. Before the
  production sync: the backfill plan (sequential or parallel connections against the rate limits), DERIVE time and memory, the
  database size, and the reports' latency at that scale (Home is per team and week since WHY 38; the rest is unmeasured there).
- [new] **Remove the TRIM step once every install is trimmed.** `jira/JiraTrimStream.kt` + `JiraRawTrim.kt` + the `trim` cursor row rewrite the raw rows
  stored before the payload trim (1.17.1) existed, once. When the dev stack and every other install show `phase: DONE` on the `trim` cursor (the data source status
  endpoint), delete the stream, the collaborator, its wiring in `JiraConnector` (SYNC and REPROCESS), its tests and the docs; a `DELETE FROM sync_cursors WHERE stream = 'trim'` migration is optional.
- [new] **Measure, then decide on the raw `issuelinks`, `subtasks` and `environment` keys.** The 1.17.1 trim keeps them (unread today, kept for follow-up measures such as
  blockers and sub-task roll-ups). After the first real sync, `jsonb_object_keys` over `raw.jira_issues.payload->'fields'` with `pg_column_size` per key shows what they cost; drop the ones nobody reads.

## Checkups — what is left (record: `.claude/docs/audit-status.md`)

- [blocked] **C6 — an OTLP exporter for `KtorServerTelemetry`.** Decided 2026-10-23: keep the telemetry, a collector is
  coming. Blocked until the collector exists; then wire the exporter (endpoint by env, off when unset).
- [new] **Two `reports.spec` throughput tests flake on CI.** In the seven worker-count dispatches of 2026-10-24 (master 50854a74, all
  green after retries) "the user regroups throughput by month" needed a retry twice (4 and 5 workers) and "a user switches throughput
  to the cumulative view" once (6 workers). Read the trace of the next failure before changing anything (the "filters are remembered"
  flake was an app bug, 1.16.1).
- [new] **A1 — protect `master`.**
  - The required checks: `server`, `web`, `e2e-static`, `gradle-vulnerability-scan`, `k8s-static`.
  - No bypass.
  - The user's decision.
- [new] **A13 — the Kubernetes front door.** The user decides between:
  - a TLS-terminating Ingress + ClusterIP Service;
  - a documented local-only overlay.

  Behind today's bare LoadBalancer, `X-Forwarded-For` is client-supplied.
- [blocked] **2C8 — the Polish glossary pass.** A judgement call that needs a native speaker.

## Security and operations

- [parked] **Instance-local auth state.** The login lockout, reset throttle and MFA challenges live in memory.
  - That's safe because the web Deployment runs one replica with Recreate.
  - Moving to several web replicas first needs Lettuce's database-backed version (its V81 auth-state tables).
- [todo] **Atlassian API-token quota: re-check developer.atlassian.com/changelog before releases.**
  - API-token traffic is excluded from the 2026 points-based rate limits.
  - Atlassian is evaluating a quota for tokens "with advance notice".

## Sibling handoffs

- [blocked] **Dispatch the sibling handoffs** (the user's to dispatch). Guardrails and fixes found while building Flow;
  Flow never edits sibling repos:
  - `~/Sources/covenant/flow-hardening-handoff.md`;
  - `~/Sources/lettuce/flow-hardening-handoff.md`;
  - `~/Sources/toadie/flow-hardening-handoff.md`.
