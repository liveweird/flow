# Jira Cloud integration

Started in v0.2.0 plan commit 4 (`feat(jira): outbound guard + Jira HTTP client + Test connection
endpoints`). Covers auth, the gateway/`cloudId` shape, rate limits/backoff, the stub, and error
codes; the raw store, streams and normalization arrive in later commits (see
`.claude/docs/ingestion.md`).

## Auth and the gateway

Every authenticated call goes through the Atlassian gateway,
`https://api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/{cloudId}/rest/...` (site-URL auth is 401 for a scoped
service-account token). `cloudId` is resolved from the ONE unauthenticated endpoint,
`GET https://<site>/_edge/tenant_info` (`HttpJiraClient.resolveCloudId`, `jira/JiraClient.kt`) —
it must run before any other call; `HttpJiraClient` throws `IllegalStateException` if it hasn't
(`JiraConnector.testConnection` treats that as every downstream probe being unreachable, not a
distinct failure of its own).

`authScheme` (`BASIC` — `Authorization: Basic base64(email:apiToken)` — or `BEARER` —
`Authorization: Bearer apiToken`) is a per-connection setting (`jiraAuthHeader`,
`jira/JiraHttp.kt`) covering the spike's uncertainty over which the real tenant needs, without a
redeploy. The token is never logged; neither is a URL with a query string (host+path only).

**Development stub.** `jira.stubBaseUrl` reroutes BOTH the tenant_info host and the gateway HOST to
`sample-data/jira-stub` (compose service or the in-JVM `JiraStubServer` test fixture) — the gateway
PATH SHAPE (`/ex/jira/{cloudId}/...`) is unchanged, only the host is substituted; there's no
separate fake `*.atlassian.net` origin. Development mode only: production startup refuses a
non-blank value (`jira/Jira.kt`'s fail-closed check, `OutboundGuardTest` pins it).

## Outbound guard

See `.claude/docs/security.md` "Outbound HTTP calls" for the full guard shape
(`infra/outbound/OutboundGuard.kt`): a host allow-list as the primary boundary
(`api.atlassian.com`, a genuine `*.atlassian.net` tenant, or — dev only — the stub host) plus the
address-range check ported from Toadie as defense in depth.

## Rate limits and backoff

`jira/JiraHttp.kt` retries 429/5xx/IOException up to `jira.maxRetries`, backing off
`min(30s, 2s·2^n) × U(0.7,1.3)` (`JiraBackoff`, pure and clock/random-injectable —
`JiraBackoffTest`), honouring a `Retry-After` header when present (clamped to 120s, taking
precedence over the exponential formula). An `X-RateLimit-NearLimit: true` response header adds a
1s pause before the NEXT call. A `Semaphore(jira.maxConcurrentRequests)` caps concurrent in-flight
calls per process. A response body is read bounded at `jira.maxResponseBytes` (default 32 MiB,
Covenant's `ToadieGraphqlClient` shape) — `LIMIT_EXCEEDED` past the cap.

## Test connection

`jira/JiraConnector.testConnection` (used by `POST /api/v1/data-sources/test` — ad-hoc, carries
`apiToken` — and `POST /api/v1/data-sources/{id}/test` — the stored, decrypted token; the latter
persists `cloudId` on success) probes each endpoint below in sequence, at most 10s each and 30s
total, NEVER throwing — every outcome is a `ConnectionTestRow {name, path, required, ok, status,
code, scopeHint}`. `required = false` rows (bulkfetch, boards + its children) may legitimately fail
on a real tenant whose scopes/GA status differ; a failure there doesn't fail the connection.

| Probe | Endpoint | Required | Likely scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tenant_info` | `GET /_edge/tenant_info` | yes | — (unauthenticated) |
| `myself` | `GET /rest/api/3/myself` | yes | `read:jira-user` |
| `search` | `GET /rest/api/3/search/jql` | yes | `read:jql:jira` |
| `field` | `GET /rest/api/3/field` | yes | `read:field:jira` |
| `statuses` | `GET /rest/api/3/statuses/search` | yes | `read:status:jira` |
| `projects` | `GET /rest/api/3/project/search` | yes | `read:project:jira` |
| `project_statuses:<KEY>` (one per configured project key) | `GET /rest/api/3/project/{key}/statuses` | yes | `read:project:jira` |
| `bulkfetch` | `POST /rest/api/3/changelog/bulkfetch` (single-id probe, not a real 50-id chunk) | **no** | uncertain GA/scope (spike fact sheet) |
| `issue_changelog` | `GET /rest/api/3/issue/{id}/changelog` | yes | `read:issue-details:jira` |
| `issue_worklog` (A1) | `GET /rest/api/3/issue/{id}/worklog` | yes | `read:issue:jira` |
| `worklog_updated` | `GET /rest/api/3/worklog/updated` | yes | — |
| `users` | `GET /rest/api/3/users/search` | yes | `read:jira-user` |
| `boards` | `GET /rest/agile/1.0/board` | **no** | `read:board-scope:jira-software` |
| `board_configuration` | `GET /rest/agile/1.0/board/{id}/configuration` | **no** | `read:board-scope.admin:jira-software` |
| `board_sprints` | `GET /rest/agile/1.0/board/{id}/sprint` | **no** | `read:sprint:jira-software` |

The `issue_*`/`bulkfetch` probes reuse the first in-scope issue id the `search` probe returns; the
`board_*` probes reuse the first board id `boards` returns. If `search`/`boards` return nothing (or
fail), their dependent probes are skipped entirely rather than guessing an id.

`POST /api/v1/data-sources/test` and `.../{id}/test` are ADMIN-only (guard before body decode),
rate-limited at 10/min per IP (`RateLimits.DATA_SOURCE_TEST`), and audited as `data_source.tested`
(siteHost, ok, failedEndpoints — never a token). Never `502`: a probe failure is a row, not a
failing HTTP status.

## Error codes (`JiraFetchException`)

`AUTHENTICATION_FAILED` (401) · `FORBIDDEN_SCOPE` (403) · `NOT_FOUND` (404) · `RATE_LIMITED` (429,
retries exhausted, OR a `Retry-After` whose wait alone would cross the remaining
`jira.requestDeadlineSeconds` budget — reported immediately rather than waited out) ·
`UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` (5xx or IOException, retries exhausted, OR the next backoff would cross that
same total-request deadline) · `TIMEOUT` (request/probe timeout) · `INVALID_RESPONSE` (malformed
JSON, an unexpected shape — every `.jsonObject`/`.jsonArray`/`.jsonPrimitive` cast is routed through
one decode helper so a mismatch is always this code, never an uncaught exception — an invalid
`cloudId` shape, or a Jira-supplied issue id/key that doesn't match the expected path shape) ·
`LIMIT_EXCEEDED` (response over `jira.maxResponseBytes`) · `BLOCKED_HOST` (the outbound guard
refused the resolved host/address — `BlockedHostException` extends `UnknownHostException`, the
`Dns` contract's own checked type, so OkHttp's async call path delivers it to Ktor unwrapped instead
of re-wrapping it as a generic `IOException`; a single attempt, never retried) · `REDIRECT` (a 3xx —
never followed) · `CURSOR_EXPIRED` (reserved for the `search/jql` `nextPageToken` expiry case — not
yet detected specifically; falls back to `INVALID_RESPONSE` today, revisit once the ISSUES stream
lands in plan commit 6).

Every attempt (across every retry) is additionally bounded by a TOTAL per-request deadline
(`jira.requestDeadlineSeconds`, default 180s, config-validated via `requireConfigInt`) — separate
from `jira.requestTimeoutSeconds`, which only bounds a SINGLE attempt — so unbounded retries can
never hold the `jira.maxConcurrentRequests` `Semaphore` permit indefinitely.

## Testing

- `JiraBackoffTest` — pure backoff math, injected clock/random.
- `JiraJqlTest` — `JiraJql`'s scope/incremental/reconcile builders.
- `OutboundGuardTest` — the allow-list, every blocked address range (injected resolver), the
  stub-host-only-in-dev rule, a boot test pinning production's `jira.stubBaseUrl` refusal, and a
  set of production-wiring integration tests (`buildGuardedJiraHttpClient`, the SAME builder
  `jira/Jira.kt` uses) against the real, loopback `JiraStubServer` over the real OkHttp engine:
  `BLOCKED_HOST` in one attempt/no retry, a disallowed host never reaching the resolver, `Proxy.
  NO_PROXY`, and a real 3xx never followed.
- `JiraConnectorTest` — `testConnection`'s probe loop against a hand-written `JiraClient` fake: a
  raw-cast `IllegalArgumentException` anywhere becomes an `INVALID_RESPONSE` row rather than an
  uncaught crash, a genuine coroutine cancellation is never swallowed as a row, and a probe honours
  the REMAINING 30s total budget, not just its own fixed 10s cap.
- `JiraClientTest` — `JiraHttp`/`HttpJiraClient` against a Ktor `MockEngine`: status→code mapping,
  429-then-`RATE_LIMITED`, the byte cap, malformed JSON, a refused redirect, `nextPageToken`
  paging, and both auth header shapes.
- `JiraStubServer` — the shared in-JVM WireMock fixture over `sample-data/jira-stub` (the SAME
  mappings the compose stack serves); `DataSourceTestConnectionTest` drives the real Test-connection
  endpoints against it, including per-test WireMock override mappings for the `FORBIDDEN_SCOPE`/
  `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED` cases and the rate-limit bucket.
