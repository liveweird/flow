# Jira ingestion (v0.2.0)

This doc grows commit by commit alongside the v0.2.0 Jira Cloud ingestion work (see the Product
section of `CLAUDE.md` for the roadmap). It starts with the role split that every later ingestion
commit builds on; the sync-job queue, the Jira client, the raw/normalized data model and the data
profile each add their own section as they land.

## Roles

One codebase and one image serve three process shapes, switched by `FLOW_ROLE` (`app.role` in
`server/src/main/resources/application.yaml`, read once at boot by `plugins/Role.kt` into
`AppRole { WEB, WORKER, ALL }`):

- **`web`** serves the HTTP API — every feature route module (`configureUserRoutes`,
  `configureTeamRoutes`, `configureAuthRoutes`, …) plus the SPA/static catch-all
  (`plugins/Routing.kt`) — but runs no ingestion worker.
- **`worker`** serves only the health/ready probes (`plugins/Health.kt` — `/api/v1/health` and
  `/api/v1/ready`, its one HTTP surface) and runs the ingestion worker
  (`ingest/IngestWorker.kt`, arriving in commit 5 of the v0.2.0 plan: the sync-job scheduler,
  lease/heartbeat claim loop and the Jira sync/reconcile/reprocess/purge jobs).
- **`all`** (the default — unset `FLOW_ROLE`) does both in one process.

`Flyway` and `Bootstrap` always run, in every role: schema and seed state must be current
regardless of which surface a given instance serves. An unrecognized `FLOW_ROLE` value fails
startup in every mode — a bad role is a deploy-time config error, not something to limp along
with.

`Application.servesApi()` (true for `WEB`/`ALL`) is the guard every feature route module and the
SPA catch-all check first; `Application.runsWorker()` (true for `WORKER`/`ALL`) is its counterpart
for the ingestion worker.

**Dev, `docker compose` and the test suite run `all`** — a single process, the simplest shape for
local iteration and CI. **Production runs a `web` Deployment and a separate `worker` Deployment**
(`k8s/web-deployment.yaml` renamed from `app-deployment.yaml`, `k8s/worker-deployment.yaml` — both
arriving in v0.2.0 commit 5), so the worker's long-running Jira syncs scale and restart
independently of the request-serving replicas, and only the `web` Deployment sits behind the
Service. Set the environment variable:

```
FLOW_ROLE=web     # or worker, or all (default)
```

See the [run-stack skill](../skills/run-stack/SKILL.md) for how this fits into local dev, compose
and Kubernetes, and the README's environment-variable table for `FLOW_ROLE`'s default and purpose.
